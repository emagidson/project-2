        <h2>About the Linus Foundation:</h2>
        <p>Since its inception in 2005, The Linus Foundation has disbursed nearly $200,000 to local non-profit organizations spanning the nation as well as Internationally. Through unique fund-raising events and national initiatives Linus has raised awareness and SUPPORT for a variety of local programs targeting children in need. Linus aims to build on its initial core business model of funding local charity organizations through volunteer opportunities and partnerships with our beneficiaries. More recently Linus has aimed to develop and manage direct impact programs of our own. Our network of supporters and volunteers CONTINUES to grow, and we want you to be a part of it. So Get Involved, and help change the life of a child in your community.<p/>

        <p> Through the combined focus of more than one hundred highly ambitious young professionals in fields ranging from Law to Graphic Design, the Linus Foundation orchestrates high-quality benefits utilizing our varied skillsets to minimize costs and maximize our output. Linus Foundation events serve to connect friends--old and new--with worthwhile causes while emphasizing that charity can be fun. This notion of fun is at the core of our foundation and at the forefront of each step we take in serving our communities.

        As The Linus Foundation has grown, so has its outreach. Today, our group works hand-in-hand with exceptional charities to establish initiatives that support children in our various communities. We have also harnessed our network of young leaders to sustain these initiatives. <p/>
